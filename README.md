# MailPinger v0.8



Will just send emails to an address rapidly using googles SMTP. Google will stop sending emails after around 300. this was built with burn accounts in mind. 
The next versions will have automatic multiple account handling, proxies & multiple targets. (WIP)

(made this to test how a custom smtp server handled high stress traffic)


usage python MailPinger.py
